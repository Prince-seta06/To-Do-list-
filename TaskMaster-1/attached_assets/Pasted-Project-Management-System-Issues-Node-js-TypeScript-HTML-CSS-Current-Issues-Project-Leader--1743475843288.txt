Project Management System Issues (Node.js + TypeScript + HTML + CSS)
Current Issues:
Project Leader Cannot Add Tasks:

The system does not properly recognize the logged-in user as the leader, preventing them from adding tasks to the project’s to-do list.

Possible session/authentication issues or incorrect leader verification in the backend.

Incorrect Task Assignment Display in Personal To-Do List:

Tasks in the personal to-do list should NOT display "Unassigned" or "Assigned to [Member]".

Only the project’s to-do list should show who the task is assigned to.

Expected Fixes & Behavior:
✅ Fix Leader Task Creation Issue:

Ensure the backend correctly identifies the project leader based on session/authentication.

The leader must be able to add tasks to the project’s to-do list and assign them to any project member (including themselves).

Debug session handling and verify that API endpoints properly check the user’s role.

✅ Fix Task Assignment Display:

The project’s to-do list should correctly display who each task is assigned to.

The personal to-do list should only show tasks assigned to the logged-in user without displaying "Unassigned" or "Assigned to [Member]".

Potential Fixes & Debugging Steps:
Check Leader Verification in Backend:

Verify the logic that determines whether the logged-in user is the project leader.

Debug how the project leader role is stored in the session/database and retrieved in API calls.

Ensure Task Assignment Updates Properly:

Check the database schema to confirm that task assignments are stored correctly.

Ensure that when fetching tasks for a user, only their assigned tasks are retrieved for the personal to-do list.

Fix Frontend Display of Assigned Tasks:

Ensure that the UI logic correctly differentiates between the personal and project to-do lists.

Update the project to-do list UI to show the assigned member’s name while keeping the personal to-do list clean (without assignment labels).

Clarification Questions for Fixing:
How is the project leader role currently determined? (Is it stored in a session, JWT, or database lookup?)

How are tasks currently being retrieved and displayed in both the project and personal to-do lists?
