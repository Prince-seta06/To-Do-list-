Issues:

Personal To-Do List: Users cannot directly add a task to their personal to-do list.

Leader Self-Assignment: The project leader is unable to assign a task to himself.

Project Count: The number of projects displayed on the personal dashboard does not update dynamically even when a project is active.

Dynamic Updates: The project progress bar and project deletion do not update instantlyâ€”they require a page reload.

Task Assignment Details: In the project task list, below the "Assigned to" field, it should also display who assigned the task.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, TypeScript

Backend: Node.js

Expected Behavior:

Users should be able to add tasks directly to their personal to-do list.

The project leader must be able to assign tasks to himself, and the system should recognize this.

The personal dashboard should dynamically update the number of active projects.

The project view should update the progress bar and reflect project deletions immediately without needing a reload.

The project task list should show not only who the task is assigned to, but also indicate who assigned the task.

Potential Solutions & Considerations:

Personal To-Do List:

Verify the API endpoint and UI logic for adding personal tasks. Ensure that the correct user ID is passed and saved.

Leader Self-Assignment:

Check the backend role/permission logic to confirm that the project leader is permitted to assign tasks to himself.

Ensure that the request payload for task creation includes proper identification of the leader.

Dynamic Project Count:

Implement real-time updates (using WebSockets, polling, or state management) so that the project count on the dashboard updates automatically when a project becomes active.

Instant UI Updates:

For the progress bar and project deletion, ensure that the frontend listens to state changes or triggers API re-fetches immediately after an action, eliminating the need for a manual page reload.

Task Assignment Details:

Modify the task display logic in the project view to include a field indicating who assigned each task, in addition to the current "Assigned to" information.
