Personal Task Insertion: Users are no longer able to directly insert tasks into their personal to-do list.

Project Task Visibility: Not all tasks are visible in the project view; even tasks not assigned to the logged-in user should be visible to all project members.

Project Count Update: The projects count in the personal dashboard does not update automatically even when an active project exists.

Leader Self-Assignment: The project leader is still unable to assign a task to himself within a project.

Task Deletion Behavior: Tasks only appear to be deleted after reloading the page, and then they are removed automatically (i.e., the deletion isn’t reflected immediately in the UI).

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, TypeScript (frontend) + Node.js (backend)

Expected Behavior:

Personal To-Do List:

Users must be able to add tasks directly to their personal to-do list.

Project Task Visibility:

The project view should display all tasks associated with the project, regardless of who they are assigned to.

Dashboard Project Count:

The project count on the personal dashboard should update dynamically as projects are added, modified, or removed.

Leader Self-Assignment:

The project leader must be able to assign tasks to himself within the project.

Instant Task Deletion:

When a task is deleted, the change should be reflected immediately in the UI without requiring a page reload.

Potential Solutions & Debugging Steps:

Personal Task Insertion:

Verify that the API endpoint for personal task creation is functioning correctly and that the UI logic sends the proper user ID and task details.

Check for any filtering or permission logic that might block personal tasks from being added.

Project Task Visibility:

Adjust the query or API call fetching project tasks so that it returns all tasks, regardless of assignment status.

Update the UI to display the complete task list for the project.

Dynamic Dashboard Count:

Implement real-time updates (using WebSockets, polling, or state management) to update the project count in the dashboard whenever project changes occur.

Leader Self-Assignment:

Debug the role verification logic on the backend to ensure that the leader’s account is recognized correctly when assigning tasks to himself.

Verify that the request payload for task assignment includes proper credentials for self-assignment.

Instant Task Deletion:

Ensure that after a task deletion API call, the frontend immediately updates the UI state without requiring a full page reload.

Check that the deletion event properly triggers a state update or re-fetch of tasks.
